# Stock_price_prediction
We will make a model that best predicts the price of a stock
Simple Stock Price Predictor üìà
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts the next day's stock closing price using a simple Linear Regression model.

This project fetches historical stock data, trains a model to learn the relationship between the current day's price and the next day's price, and then makes a prediction.

Features
Fetches real-time historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Uses a Linear Regression model to forecast the next day's price.

Visualizes the model's predictions against actual prices.

Calculates Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R 
2
 ) to evaluate model performance.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

yfinance: To download market data from Yahoo Finance.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Installation & Usage
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-price-predictor.git
cd stock-price-predictor
2. Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file containing the libraries listed under "Technologies Used" or just run pip install pandas yfinance scikit-learn matplotlib)

3. Run the script:
Execute the Python script from your terminal.

Bash

python predict.py
You can change the stock ticker inside the script (e.g., from 'AAPL' to 'GOOGL') to predict prices for different companies.

How It Works
Data Fetching: The script uses the yfinance library to download historical daily stock prices for a specified ticker.

Feature Engineering: The core idea is to use today's closing price as a feature to predict tomorrow's closing price. A Next_Close column is created by shifting the Close price data by one day.

Model Training: The data is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). A LinearRegression model is trained on the training data to learn the linear relationship between the input feature and the target variable.

Prediction & Evaluation: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set. The model's accuracy is evaluated, and the results are visualized.

Sample Output
When you run the script, you'll see a terminal output and a plot.

Terminal Output:
